description: An full stack web app project built using the latest development tools fully embracing modern software architecture - a microservice architecture. Backend is a collection of small fine grained size microservices built in Java each connecting to a different database/datastore (H2, MySQL, Mongo, Redis). The frontend is built entirely using the React UI library. There exists an middleware layer consisting of an NGINX reverse proxy acting as an API gateway which proxies requests to the different backend services. You can checkout my Github repo at - https://github.com/colinbut/sales-order-system-2.git
